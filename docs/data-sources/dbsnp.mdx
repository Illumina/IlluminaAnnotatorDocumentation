## VCF Extraction:

### Example
```
1       10177   rs367896724     A       AC      .       .       RS=367896724;RSPOS=10177;dbSNPBuildID=138;SSR=0;SAO=0;VP=0x050000020005130026000200;GENEINFO=DDX11L1:100287102;WGT=1;VC=DIV;R5;ASP;G5A;G5;KGPhase3;CAF=0.5747,0.4253;COMMON=1;TOPMED=0.76728147298674821,0.23271852701325178
```
The following fields are extracted:
- RS ID
- Global minor allele
- Global minor allele frequency
- Global major allele
- Global major allele frequency

### Global allele extraction
The global major and minor allele are extracted based on the frequency of the alleles provided in the CAF field. The global minor allele frequency is the second highest value of the CAF comma delimited field (ignoring '.' values). However, if there are two candidates for global major and the ref allele is one of them, we prefer the reference allele. On the other hand, if there are two candidates for global minor and the ref allele is one of them, we prefer the other alleles over the ref. If the ref allele is not involved, they are chosen arbitrarily . Here are a few examples to illustrate out policy:

*Example 1:*

```Chr1 100 A C CAF=0.5,0.5```

we will select A to be the Global major and C to be the Global minor allele.

*Example 2:*

```Chr1 100 A C,T CAF=0.33,0.33,0.33```

we will select A to be the Global major and either C or T is chosen (arbitrarily) to be the Global minor allele.

*Example 3:*

```Chr1 100 A C,T CAF=0.2,0.4,0.4```

C or T will be arbitrarily assigned to be the Global major or minor allele.

*Example 4:*

```Chr1 100 A C,T CAF=0.2,0.2,0.6```

Here T is the Global major allele while C is selected as the global minor.

## Conflict resolution
In case of multiple dbSNP entries for the same position and alternate allele, we join all ids into a comma separated list of ids; if there are multiple entries with different CAF values for the same allele, we use the first CAF value.
