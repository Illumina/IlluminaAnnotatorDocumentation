## Overview

The goal of the 1000 Genomes Project was to find most genetic variants with frequencies of at least 1% in the populations studied. It was the first project to sequence the genomes of a large number of people, to provide a comprehensive resource on human genetic variation. Data from the 1000 Genomes Project was quickly made available to the worldwide scientific community through freely accessible public databases.

## Populations
* The super population membership can be found here: (http://www.1000genomes.org/category/population/)
* We want to capture the allele frequencies for all 26 populations as well as the 5 super populations and the total population.

## Small Variants
### VCF File Parsing
Parse the 1000 Genomes vcf file and extract the following fields:
* AA
* AF
* EAS_AF
* AMR_AF
* AFR_AF
* EUR_AF

The fields relevant to parsing the desired information are described in the VCF header as follows:
```scss
##INFO=<ID=AC,Number=A,Type=Integer,Description="Total number of alternate alleles in called genotypes">
##INFO=<ID=AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Estimated allele frequency in the range (0,1)">
##INFO=<ID=EAS_AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Allele frequency in the EAS populations \
calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1)">
##INFO=<ID=EUR_AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Allele frequency in the EUR populations \
calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1)">
##INFO=<ID=AFR_AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Allele frequency in the AFR populations \
calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1)">
##INFO=<ID=AMR_AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Allele frequency in the AMR populations \
calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1)">
##INFO=<ID=SAS_AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Allele frequency in the SAS populations \
calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1)">
##INFO=<ID=AA,Number=1,Type=String,Description="Ancestral Allele. Format: AA|REF|ALT|IndelType. \
AA: Ancestral allele, REF:Reference Allele, ALT:Alternate Allele, IndelType:Type of Indel (REF, ALT and IndelType are only defined for indels)">
```
All frequency related information comes in comma separated allele specific fields and are parsed into allele specific annotations. The ancestral allele, if it exists, is the first value in the pipe separated AA fields (the Indel specific REF, ALT, IndelType fields are ignored).

**NOTE**: The actual allele counts and allele numbers are not expressed in the INFO field. Instead the genotypes need to be parsed to directly compute that information.
#### Example

```scss
#CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO
1       15274   rs62636497      A       G,T     100     PASS    AC=1739,3210;AF=0.347244,0.640974; \
EAS_AF=0.4812,0.5188; AMR_AF=0.2752,0.7205;AFR_AF=0.323,0.6369;EUR_AF=0.2922,0.7078;SAS_AF=0.3497,0.6472;AA=g|||;
```

#### Conflict Resolution

Take the following example:
```scss
#CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO
1 20505705 rs35377696 C CTCTG,CTG,CTGTG 100 PASS AC=46,1513,152;AF=0.0091853,0.302117,0.0303514;
1 20505705 rs35377696 C CTG 100 PASS AC=4;AF=0.000798722;
```
That is, the variant 1-20505705-C-CTG has conflicting entries. To get an idea of how frequently we observe this, here is a table summarizing ChrX and all chromosomes. Note that almost all such entries are found in ChrX.

|Chromosome | \# of alleles    | \# of conflicting alleles | percentage|
|:---------:|:-----------------|:--------------:|:-----------------|
| chrX      |       834800     |       2733     |           0.33%  |
| Total     |       21413098   |       2743     |           0.013% |

**Currently**, we removed the allele frequency of the conflicting allele (i.e., insertion TG in the example )but keep allele frequencies of all others.

**Potential Alternate Solutions**
* Remove all alleles that are contained in the vcf lines which have conflicting allele. (Recommended by 1000 genome group Holly Zheng-Bradley, 7/29/2015)
* Recalculate the allele frequency for the conflicting allele.
* Pick the allele frequency that has the highest data support.
## Known Issues

:::caution Known Issues
If there are multiple entries with different CAF values for the same allele, we use the first CAF value.

## Structural Variants
### VCF File Parsing

1000 Genomes contains 5 types of structural variants:
* CNV
* DEL
* DUP
* INS
* INV

Since data of 1000 genomes is provided in VCF format, we assume that the coordinates follow the vcf format, i.e., there is a padding base for symbolic alleles. So all the interval can be interpreted as [BEGIN+1, END].
Similarly, for all other variant types except insertion, END is far larger than BEGIN. The distribution of BEGIN and END for insertions is summarized below.

**Insertion issues**
* END = BEGIN for 6/165
* END = BEGIN+2 for 93/165
* END = BEGIN+3 for 11/165
* END = BEGIN+4 for 11/165
* END – BEGIN range from 5 to 1156 for others.

#### Example

```scss
#CHROM  POS     ID      REF     ALT     QUAL    FILTER  INFO    FORMAT  HG00096 HG00097 HG00099 HG00100 HG00101 HG00102 HG00103

AC=9,87,599,20;AF=0.00179712,0.0173722,0.119609,0.00399361;AN=5008;CS=DUP_gs;END=16063474;NS=2504;SVTYPE=CNV;DP=22545;\
EAS_AF=0.001,0.0169,0.2361,0.0099;AMR_AF=0,0.0101,0.219,0.0072;AFR_AF=0.0061,0.0363,0.0053,0;EUR_AF=0,0.007,0.0944,0.003;\
SAS_AF=0,0.0082,0.1094,0.002;VT=SV       GT      3|0     0|0     0|0     0|0     0|0     0|0     0|4
```
CNVs are allele-specific. For example, HG00096 is effectively copy number 4, which would be a net gain on chr22.

### Converting VCF svTypes to SO sequence alterations
The svType will be captured in our JSON file under the [sequenceAlteration](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001059) key. Here's the translation we'll use according to svType in 1000 Genomes.
