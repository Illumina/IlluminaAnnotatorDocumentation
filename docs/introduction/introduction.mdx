Nirvana provides clinical-grade annotation of genomic variants (SNVs, MNVs, insertions, deletions, indels, STRs, gene fusions, and SVs (including CNVs). It can be run as a stand-alone package, as an AWS Lambda function, or integrated into larger software tools that require variant annotation.

The input to Nirvana are VCFs and the output is a structured JSON representation of all annotation and sample information (as extracted from the VCF). Nirvana handles multiple alternate alleles and multiple samples with ease.

The software is being developed under a rigorous SDLC and testing process to ensure accuracy of the results and enable embedding in other software with regulatory needs. Nirvana uses a continuous integration pipeline where millions of variant annotations are monitored against baseline values daily.

## What does Nirvana annotate?

We use Sequence Ontology consequences to describe how each variant impacts a given transcript:

In addition, we also use external data sources to provide additional context for each variant:
